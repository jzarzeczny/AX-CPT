# AX-CPT test presentation

Aim of this program is to demonstate the practical usage of AX-CPT test used in psychology in order to measure stuff like for instance cognitive control.

Demo was created to illustrate the mechanisim (it's quite complitated) of the test and as my first project while learning programming.
