# AX-CPT test presentation

Aim of this program is to demonstate the practical usage of AX-CPT test used in psychology in order to measure stuff like for instance cognitive control.

Demo was created to illustrate the mechanisim (it's quite complitated) of the test and as my first project while learning programming.

## Versions

### 0.4

Its working! Im aware that code is trash + its simply, however it's working.

Currently it allows to check how each pair works (clue - probe) + perform simple test.

In next version -> object, async js, get rid of known bugs
